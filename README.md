## Bomberman - Doomsday (WIP)

This is a game inspired from Bomberman (1983), made in pure C with custom framework which relies and combines flecs and SDL. Its currently WIP.
The package in deps should be found on github under the same name. For pluto and game_modules, you can find them on my personnal Azure DevOps repos:
